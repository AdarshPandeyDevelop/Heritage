        <p class="p11">"A digital canvas, where thoughts take flight,
            Yet, incomplete, a humbling sight.
            For knowledge vast, an ocean deep,
            No mortal mind its depths can keep.
            We strive and learn, with ceaseless care,
            But perfect wisdom, beyond compare.
            So, let this space evolve and grow,
            A testament to what we know,
            And what remains, a mystery still,
            Beyond the reach of human will. Because we only know about the last 5000 years but always remember that human history is about 200000 years old."</p>
